The Raincatcher Demo Solution Architecture
------------------------------------------

[[overview]]
Overview
~~~~~~~~

This guide presents an introduction to the Demo solution available for
the Raincatcher project. This solution is intended to demonstrate how
the Raincatcher module ecosystem can combine to produce a functional
Workforce Management solution.

The Raincatcher Demo solution is intended to be a reference
implementation of a Workforce management solution. This solution
contains modules that are related specifically to Red Hat Mobile
Application Platform features, and is therefore currently only
functional with access to a RHMAP platform instance.

Some examples of RHMAP plaform specific modules include:

* The
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-appform[raincatcher-appform]
module uses APIs specific to the Drag & Drop Apps feature of the RHMAP
platform.
* The
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-push[raincatcher-push]
module uses the Aerogear Push API to send push notifications.
* The
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-sync[raincatcher-sync]
module uses Client and Cloud APIs specific to the RHMAP Sync framework.
* The
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-user[raincatcher-user]
modules uses RHMAP Auth Policies to validate users.

This guide will:

* Present the concept of a Raincatcher module.
* Present the architecture of the Demo solution, highlighting how the
Demo solution combines different Raincatcher modules.
* Illustrate how the functionality of the Demo solution can be expanded
by adding an additional Raincatcher module.

[[what-is-a-raincatcher-module]]
What Is A Raincatcher Module?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before describing the Demo solution, it is necessary to introduce the
concept of a Raincatcher module.

The Raincatcher project is based on the principle of multiple,
loosely-coupled modules communicating through the mediator pattern.
Raincatcher modules make use of the
https://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/[mediator pattern] to enable
loose coupling between the Raincatcher modules and their consuming
applications / modules.

There are several important concepts that the Raincatcher modules
exploit to work correctly:

* The Raincatcher Mediator
* The Raincatcher Module User Interface
* Bridging The Mediator Events Between Client And Cloud

To illustrate these concepts, there is a smaller tutorial solution that
incorporates:

* https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-tutorial-module[A
simple Raincatcher module].
* https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-tutorial-client[A
simple Client App incorporating the Raincatcher module]
* https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-tutorial-cloud[A
simple Cloud App incorporating the Raincatcher module]

You can clone these repositories and run them locally to see the
Raincatcher module bridging functionality. It is recommended that you
become familiar with this simpler solution to get a good understanding
of Raincatcher concepts before attempting to

[[raincatcher-mediator]]
Raincatcher Mediator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Raincatcher project, the
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-mediator/blob/master/README.md[Raincatcher
mediator] module is a module implementing the mediator pattern. All
Raincatcher modules must publish and subscribe to the same mediator in
order to communicate.

In the next section, the naming conventions for how Raincatcher modules
communicate are described.

[[mediator-pattern-namespacing]]
Mediator Pattern Namespacing
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the Raincatcher project, all modules can subscribe and publish
messages to the mediator. In order to differentiate between mediator
events between topics, it is necessary to namespace the messages that
are published.

Topics in Raincatcher are defined as text fields separated by a __:__.
E.g. ``wfm:user:list''. Raincatcher topics are prefixed by _wfm_ by
convention.

Topics can have a state prefix that defines the result of a topic.

* _done_ : The `done` state defines a topic that has executed
successfully. E.g. ``done:wfm:user:list''
* _error_ : The `error` state defines a topic that has encountered an
error when executing. E.g. ``error:wfm:user:list''

[[raincatcher-module-user-interface]]
Raincatcher Module User Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Raincatcher modules use the https://angularjs.org/[AngularJS 1]
framework to enable Raincatcher modules to have their own user
interface. Having this separation of UI and business logic allows the
modules to maintain their loose coupling.

Raincatcher modules define the UI functionality in the `angular` folder
in each module. Each module is exported as an AngularJS module (e.g.
``wfm.user'' is the AngularJS module name for the
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-user/blob/master/lib/angular/user-ng.js[Raincatcher
User] module.)

Currently, AngularJS 1 is the only UI framework implemented into the
Raincatcher modules.

[[bridging-the-mediator-events-between-client-and-cloud]]
Bridging The Mediator Events Between Client And Cloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the main concepts in the Raincatcher modules is the bridging of
mediator events between the Client and Cloud in the same module. By
doing this, it allows client topics to propagate to the Cloud and vice
versa. Any other dependent modules on the cloud can then subscribe to
the event for further processing on the cloud side.

image:assets/images/mobile-bridging.png[Illustration Of Bridging Between
Client and Cloud In Raincatcher Modules]

In the illustration above, we can see that the Client and Cloud apps
have a very similar structure. The same Raincatcher modules are added as
dependencies in both the Client and Cloud apps. The key here is that the
Raincatcher modules are capable of propagating topics from Client to
Cloud and vice versa. By doing this, all of code required for both
client and cloud functionality is contained in the same module.

From the point of view of the application developer, the mechanism for
bridging the client/cloud divide is abstracted by the Raincatcher
module.

_Note:_ Not all Raincatcher modules must have topic propagation between
client and cloud. For example, the
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-camera[raincatcher-camera]
module only has a client side component. However, there is nothing
stopping a developer expanding this module to automatically forward
taken photos to a server if they wish.

As an example:

* The
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-user[raincatcher-user]
module uses HTTP requests to send topics to the cloud endpoints. This is
only a client-cloud communication.
* The
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-workorder[raincatcher-workorder]
module uses the
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-sync[raincatcher-sync]
module. The _raincatcher-sync_ module provides a mechanism to have
two-way client-cloud topic propigation.
