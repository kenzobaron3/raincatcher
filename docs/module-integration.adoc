Overview
~~~~~~~~

This document presents a guide to how a new Raincatcher module would be
integrated into the existing Demo Solution to provide extra
functionality.

It is recommended that you have a link:running-locally.adoc[local setup]
of the Raincatcher solution set up before following this guide. This
will allow for easier editing and feedback.

[[scenario]]
Scenario
~~~~~~~~

The existing Raincatcher solution is capable of showing the current
location of work orders on a map. However, what if an administrator
would like to see where workers are at any give time? It is not
currently a feature in the Raincatcher Demo project.

This guide will introduce this functionality by integrating a new
raincatcher module:
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-gps[raincatcher-gps].
This module publishes and subscribes to location based topics.

Changes Necessary To Integrate The Raincatcher-GPS Module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several changes required to integrate the raincatcher-gps
module into the Demo Project:

* Update the raincatcher-demo-mobile app to add the new raincatcher-gps
module.
* Update the raincatcher-user module to propagate user location updates
to the Cloud.
* Update the raincatcher-demo-auth app to handle location update topics.
* Update the raincatcher-map module to handle displaying user locations
on the map.
* Update the raincatcher-demo-portal application to pass users to the
raincatcher-map scope.

[[update-the-raincatcher-demo-mobile-app-to-add-the-new-raincatcher-gps-module]]
1. Update the raincatcher-demo-mobile app to add the new raincatcher-gps
module
+
The goal of this change is to capture the location of mobile workers in
the field as they complete work orders. To do this, we can add the
raincatcher-gps module to the raincatcher-gps module by:

[[a.-include-the-raincatcher-gps-module-in-the-main-app-dependencies]]
  .. Include the raincatcher-gps module in the main app dependencies
+
Run `npm install fh-wfm-gps --save` to install the raincatcher-gps
module and automatically add it to the dependencies in the
`package.json` file.
+
In the `src/app.js` file, the `fh-wfm-gps` module is included in the
main angular dependencies.

[[b.-create-a-new-service-to-publish-and-subscribe-to-location-events]]
  .. Create a new service to publish and subscribe to location events
+
The raincatcher-mobile app is responsible for managing the location
based messages passing between the raincatcher-gps module and
raincatcher-user module.
+
A new file, `src/app/location/user-location-service.js`, file is added
to create a service that will be instantiated when the app is loaded.
+
This will create the `UserLocationService` that will be instantiated by
AngularJS.
+
This service will periodically publish the `wfm:gps:location:update`
topic that is subscribed to by the `raincatcher-gps` module.
+
Whenever the `done:wfm:gps:location:update` topic is published, a check
is made to see if a user is logged in. If this is the case, then the
`wfm:user:location:update` topic is published.
+
The `wfm:user:location:update` topic is subscribed to by the new
functionality in the `raincatcher-user` module. See the
link:#update-the-raincatcher-user-module-to-propagate-user-location-updates-to-the-cloud[next]
section for details on the updates to the `raincatcher-user` module.
+
[source,javascript]
----
module.exports = 'wfm-mobile.location';
//The config values are obtained from the src/app/config.js file.
var config = require('../config');

angular.module('wfm-mobile.location', ['wfm.core.mediator']).service('UserLocationService', ['mediator', 'gps',  UserLocationService]);

/**
 * This service is responsible for subscribing to location updates from the raincatcher-gps module.
 *
 * These updates are then propigated to the raincatcher-user module to update the users current locaion.
 *
 * @param mediator
 * @constructor
 */
function UserLocationService(mediator) {
  var self = this;

  /**
   *
   * Getting the logged in user profile. This will be used to get the current user ID.
   *
   * @returns {object/null}
   */
  function retrieveProfileData() {
    var json = localStorage.getItem('fh.wfm.profileData');
    return json ? JSON.parse(json) : null;
  }

  //Subscribing to the `done` state for the `wfm:gps:location:update` topic.
  //This will update the users current location.
  mediator.subscribe('done:wfm:gps:location:update', function(location) {
    var coordinates = location.coords;

    var localUserData = retrieveProfileData();

    //The user may not be logged in yet.
    if(localUserData) {

      //Having a new location, we can publish the `wfm:user:location:update` topic for the raincatcher-user module.
      //The raincatcher-user module will propagate the updated location to the cloud.
      mediator.publish('wfm:user:location:update', localUserData.id, {
        latitude: coordinates.latitude,
        longitude: coordinates.longitude
      });
    }
  });

  self.interval = setInterval(function() {
    mediator.publish('wfm:gps:location:update');
  }, config.locationPollingInterval);

  //When the user logs out of the app, the polling process can stop.
  mediator.subscribe('wfm:user:logout', function() {
    clearInterval(self.interval);
  });
}
----
+
The `config.locationPollingInterval` value (in ms) is obtained from the
main app config which is defined in the `src/app/config.js` file.
+
[source,javascript]
----
{
  ...
  locationPollingInterval: 2000
  ...
}

+
[[c.-add-the-new-location-service-as-a-dependency-of-the-wfm-mobile.auth-module]]
  .. Add the new location service as a dependency of the wfm-mobile.auth
module
+
In the `src/app/auth/auth.js` file, add the `wfm-mobile.location`
service as a dependency of the `wfm-mobile.auth` module. This is to
ensure that the `UserLocationService` is instantiated when the
`LoginCtrl` controller is loaded.
+
[source,javascript]
----
angular.module('wfm-mobile.auth', [
  'ui.router',
  'wfm.core.mediator',
  //Loading the wfm-mobile.location module to allow polling of the mobile user location.
  'wfm-mobile.location'
])

.controller('LoginCtrl', ['userClient', 'hasSession', 'UserLocationService', function(userClient, hasSession) {
...

[[update-the-raincatcher-user-module-to-propagate-user-location-updates-to-the-cloud]]
2. Update the raincatcher-user module to propagate user location updates
to the Cloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the previous step, we added functionality to the
raincatcher-demo-mobile app to subscribe to an updated location
published by the `raincatcher-gps` module and publish a
`wfm:user:location:update` topic with the user ID and updated location.

To assign this updated value to the user and push the updated value to
the cloud, something has to subscribe to the user position update topic.
This functionality could be built into the `raincatcher-demo-mobile`,
`raincatcher-demo-portal` and `raincatcher-demo-auth` applications
directly without changing any of the modules.

However, updating a user location would be a useful feature to have in
the raincatcher-user module. It would mean any applications that consume
the raincatcher-user module could update the user location through
whichever means they wish. It is not bound in any way to the
`raincatcher-gps` module.

The update the raincatcher-user module, the following changes are made:

[[a.-update-the-userclient-to-subscribe-to-the-user-location-update-topic.]]
a. Update the UserClient to subscribe to the user location update topic.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the `lib/user/user-client.js` file, the constructor for the
`UserClient` is updated to subscribe to the user location update topic

[source,javascript]
----
...
//Subscribing to the user location update topic.
//This subscriber will push the updated location to the cloud back end.
this.mediator.subscribe('wfm:user:location:update', function(userId, location) {
    self.updateLocation(userId, location);
});
...
----

The `updateLocation` function is also added to the `UserClient` to
create the HTTP request to the cloud side of the raincatcher-user
module.

[source,javascript]
----
/**
 *
 * Pushing an updated user location, in latitude and longitude, to the cloud backend.
 *
 * @param {string} userId    The ID of the user to update
 * @param {object} location  The updated location to save
 * @param {number} location.latitude  The latitude of the location to update
 * @param {number} location.longitude The longitude of the location to update
 */
UserClient.prototype.updateLocation = function(userId, location) {
  return this.initPromise.then(function() {
    xhr({
      path: config.apiPath + '/' + userId + "/location",
      method: 'put',
      data: location
    })
  });
};
----

[[b.-update-the-backend-cloud-router-with-the-new-location-update-endpoint]]
b. Update the backend cloud router with the new location update endpoint
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the Raincatcher solution, user authentication is provided by the
`raincatcher-demo-auth` application. (See the
link:demo-solution-architecture.adoc[architecture guide] for an
illustration of the demo solution.)

Update the `lib/user/user-router.js` file to include a new endpoint for
handling the location update requests from the `UserClient` in the
previous requests.

[source,javascript]
----
//Sending the update request to the mbaas handler in the raincatcher-auth service. This is where the user data is stored.
router.route('/:id/location').put( function(req, res, next) {
    //The delegate will handle sending the update request to the raincatcher-demo-auth application running elsewhere.
    //The raincatcher-demo-auth application is responsible for storing user details and authentication.
    //Therefore, the location update request must pass to this app.
    delegate.updateLocation(req.params.id, _.pick(req.body, 'longitude', 'latitude')).then(function(updatedUser) {
      res.json(updatedUser);
    }, next);
});
----

Also add the `updateLocation` function to the `delegate` handling
sending the request to the `raincatcher-demo-auth` app.

[source,javascript]
----
/**
 *
 * Function to proxy location update requests to the mbaas service endpoint for handling user location update requests.
 *
 * @param {string} userId    The ID of the user to update
 * @param {object} location  The updated location to save
 * @param {number} location.latitude  The latitude of the location to update
 * @param {number} location.longitude The longitude of the location to update
 */
Delegate.prototype.updateLocation = function(userId, location) {
  return this.xhr({
    path: '/api/wfm/user/' + userId + "/location",
    method: 'PUT',
    params: {
      location: location
    }
  });
};
----

[[c.-update-the-mbaas-service-endpoint-to-handle-proxied-requests-from-the-backend-cloud-app]]
c. Update the MBaaS service endpoint to handle proxied requests from the
backend cloud app
+
In the previous step, we update the backend cloud app to handle requests
from the `UserClient` in Step 1.
+
We must now update the MBaaS service endpoint to handle the proxied
request from Step 2.
+
In the `lib/router/mbaas.js` file, add the handler for the location
update http request.
+
[source,javascript]
----
//Route for updating the location for a single user in the mbaas service.
router.route('/:id/location').put(function(req, res) {
var userId = req.params.id;
var locationToUpdate = req.body.location;

//Only interested in the location update for this single user
mediator.once('done:wfm:user:location:update:' + userId, function(saveduser) {
    //Returning the updated user to the cloud request.
    res.json(saveduser);
});

mediator.publish('wfm:user:location:update', userId, locationToUpdate);
});
----

[[update-the-raincatcher-demo-auth-app-to-handle-location-update-topics]]
3. Update the raincatcher-demo-auth app to handle location update topics
+
In the demo solution, the management of saved users is the
responsibility of the `raincatcher-demo-auth` app.
+
The `lib/user.js` module sets up subscribers to the CRUD operations that
affect the current set of users. Therefore, it is the the place where
the subscriber to the `wfm:user:location:update` topic should reside.
+
[source,javascript]
----
//Update a user location
var topicUpdateLocation = 'wfm:user:location:update';
mediator.subscribe(topicUpdateLocation, function(userId, location) {
    //The setTimeout is included to indicate that the update of a user can be an asynchronous process.
    //E.g. the users are saved to a mongodb database instead of in-memory.
    setTimeout(function() {
      var index = _.findIndex(users, function(_user) {
        return _user.id === userId;
      });
      users[index].location = location;
      mediator.publish('done:' + topicUpdateLocation + ':' + userId, users[index]);
    }, 0);
});
----

[[update-the-raincatcher-map-module-to-handle-displaying-user-locations-on-the-map]]
4. Update the raincatcher-map module to handle displaying user locations
on the map
+
In the steps above, we have completed the full process of capturing user
locations on the mobile application and propagating them to the cloud
and MBaaS service for storage.
+
If storage of user locations was the only motivation for this change,
then this guide would be complete.
+
However, the goal of this guide is to also allow portal users to view
the location of workers on a map.
+
The
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-map[raincatcher-map]
module is responsible for the functionality related to displaying map
content.
+
The functionality for displaying map content is located in the
`lib/angular/directive.js` file.
+
To allow the inclusion of worker location tags, the following steps are
taken:

[[a.-add-the-worker-scope-to-the-directive]]
a. Add the worker scope to the directive
+
To allow the map directive to have access to the workers from the
`raincatcher-demo-portal` application, the isolated scope of the
directive must include the `workers` parameter. For more information on
isolated scopes, see the AngularJS
https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive[documentation].
+
[source,javascript]
----
{
 ...
    scope: {
      list: '=',
      center: '=',
      workorders: '=',
      //Added to display worker locations in addition to work orders.
      workers: '=',
      containerSelector: '@'
    },
  ...
}
----

[[b.-add-the-addusermarkers-function]]
b. Add the addUserMarkers function
+
The `addUserMarkers` function to display user location markers.
+
[source,javascript]
----
/**
* Function for adding worker markers to the map in addition to work order markers.
* @param {object} map     - The map to add worker markers to.
* @param {Array}  workers - An array of user object describing the workers.
*/
function addUserMarkers(map, workers) {
    //If there are no workers, then there is no need to add any worker markers on the map.
    if(!workers) {
      return;
    }
    
    workers.forEach(function(worker) {
    
      //There is no guarantee that a worker will have a location. (e.g. a new worker has been added but has never logged into a mobile app before.)
      if (worker.location) {
        var lat = worker.location.latitude;
        var long = worker.location.longitude;
        var marker = new google.maps.Marker({map: map,position: new google.maps.LatLng(lat, long)});
        //Using a different color marker to easily separate workers from work orders
        marker.setIcon('http://maps.google.com/mapfiles/ms/icons/green-dot.png');
    
        //Displaying the username and ID when the marker is clicked
        var infowindow = new google.maps.InfoWindow({content:'<strong>Worker #'+worker.id+'</strong><br>'+worker.name+'<br>'});
    
        //Whenever the marker is clicked, display the user data added above.
        google.maps.event.addListener(marker, 'click', function() {
          infowindow.open(map,marker);
        });
      }
    });
}
----

[[update-the-raincatcher-demo-portal-application-to-pass-users-to-the-raincatcher-map-scope]]

5. Update the raincatcher-demo-portal application to pass users to the
raincatcher-map scope
+
Having prepared the `raincatcher-map` module to display user locations,
use the following steps to update the raincatcher-demo-portal
application to allow the display of worker locations.

[[a.-update-the-portal-map-module-config-to-resolve-workers]]
a. Update the portal map module config to resolve workers
+
In the `src/app/map/map.js` file, the config for the `app.map` module
already has a resolver for the work orders.
+
We need to add another resolver for the _workers_ to ensure a list of
workers is available to the `mapController`.
+
[source,javascript]
----
{
  ...
  resolve : {
    ...
    //Getting a list of workers
    //This will allow adding worker locations to the map if available.
    //Using the userClient from the raincatcher-user module to list the users.
    workers: function(userClient) {
      return userClient.list();
    }
    ...
  
  }
  ...
}
----

[[b.-add-the-workers-parameter-to-the-map-directive]]
b. Add the workers parameter to the map directive
+
In the map template, the scope parameters are defined in the
`workorder-map` directive defined by the `raincatcher-map` module. This
is related to step 4.a where the isolated scope parameter list was
updated.
+
The update is made to the `src/app/map/map.tpm.html` template file.
+
[source,html]
----
<!-- Using the raincatcher-map module directive to render the map in the portal --->
<workorder-map workorders="ctrl.workorders" center="ctrl.center" workers="ctrl.workers" container-selector="#content"></workorder-map>
----
